# Zig vscode template

This is a very basic template that should allow you build/run/debug zig code from vscode.

### How to use:
1. Start a project with this template.
2. Rename your executable in `launch.json` line 8 and delete the comment.
3. Run `zig init-exe` or `zig init-lib` from the terminal depending on what you want to make.
4. Delete or edit this readme to match your project.

### Requirements
1. Have `zig` installed and available from your command line.
2. Optionally have `zls` installed and available from your commandl line (the Zig language server).
